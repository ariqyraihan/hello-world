#  _Depression Isn’t A Joke_

## _The Story_

I can’t agree more with my friend when she said depression is a great danger and don’t play with it. Yes, depression isn’t a cheap figure of speech. It’s a high level of stress which your mind can’t control sometimes. 

_The Questions_

Have you ever felt like you were alone and nobody cares about you?

Have you ever felt a deep loneliness?

Those are examples when you are so depressed. When you hold so many burdens on your minded you don’t know how to make it better. Yes, you have friends. Yes, you talk to them. But, none of them understands you.

Abuse is one of the reasons why anyone can feel depression—may be the strongest reason—which they live with deep traumatic. But, there is another reason which can lead a person to the depression feeling.

_What is it?_

Broken home. 

It’s a common thing, a broken home type person has a negative stereotype. **Few of them drown themselves to drugs, violence, messed-up life, and etc**. Their life is broken. Their happiness tears apart. They feel empty. 

It’s a wound without chemical medicine to cure. May be, it seems like you just break up with your boyfriend or girlfriend (sometimes it can lead you too to depression), but it’s more than that.

Some friends said to me, “Hei, why are these people so weak and easy to give it up?”

No, there is no easy way when you choose to live in this world. There is no easy way to keep cheer up no matter what. May be, you will be seen so fragile or so vulnerable. _But, they don’t know how the hell these persons lives_. 

Instead, to figure something out, you find a peace by entering a world you have no idea what the worst consequence is. That’s why once enter this world, there is no way out. Or takes a really long time to finally find the way out. 

## How To Deal With It

Not every broken home person lives that way. Some of them (I don’t know it’s minority or not) try to live with the burdens. You don’t want to be drown into the darkworld instead you choose to give it up. Give yourself to the whatever the dark want you to be. 

This condition borns a deep loneliness into yourself. You walk around but there is nobody here to be with you. There’s nobody here to listen to you.  Because, when this burden is growing on your head day to day, until just God knows when it stops.

So, you have two options; holding on  or give it up—die. At least these options are surrounding the head. But, why these questions exist?

When you lost your parents, you also lost a part of you—as I said above. Especially, when you are not child anymore. You understand about love, lies, letting go, separation, and etc. You begin to understand this life and then it’s broken apart. You see that every happiness you felt before just lies.

You keep believing it, day to day until it makes you crazy. You love to be in the darkness even you refuse to live in the dark world. And you know what is the crazy fact? You try to believe you are gonna be okay, make it balances, live in two sides (because your parents broke up) and sees they starting a new life.

You are happy as they think you are. But, deep inside, you know, it breaks you more.
